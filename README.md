# Employee Retention Project
---
**Employee retention is a critical challenge for modern organizations, impacting both financial sustainability and workplace productivity. Recruiting and training new hires are expensive and time-consuming processes‚Äîcompanies often spend 15‚Äì20% of an employee‚Äôs salary on recruitment, plus experience revenue loss while new hires ramp up.**
---
##### Project Overview
- **Business Challenge**:High employee turnover leads to increased costs, knowledge loss, and operational disruption. Predicting which employees are likely to leave allows proactive retention strategies and cost savings.

- **Role of Prajwal**:As a data scientist at a multinational corporation, Prajwal was tasked by the HR team to develop a predictive model that can identify employees at risk of quitting, enabling targeted interventions.

##### Dataset Description
***The HR team provided Prajwal with extensive employee data including key features such as:***

- JobInvolvement
- Education
- JobSatisfaction
- PerformanceRating
- RelationshipSatisfaction
- WorkLifeBalance...and several others crucial for understanding employee engagement and retention.

##### Systematic Step-by-Step Process
- **Step 1**: Import Libraries and Data
  - Prajwal imported libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
  - The employee dataset was loaded for analysis.

- **Step 2**: Basic Data Checks
  - Prajwal explored the dataset using .info() and .describe() to understand the shape and summary.

- **Step 3**: Data Preparation & Cleaning
  - Converted categorical columns ‚ÄòAttrition‚Äô and ‚ÄòOvertime‚Äô to integers for modeling.
  - Identified and imputed missing data.
  - Dropped irrelevant columns like EmployeeCount, StandardHours, and Over18 that had no variance.
  - Created histograms to visualize feature distributions.

- **Step 4**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Prajwal analyzed how many employees left vs. stayed, calculating percentages.
  - Compared means and standard deviations of features such as age, daily rate, and satisfaction scores between stayers and leavers.

  - Visualized important factors using KDE plots, count plots (JobRole, MaritalStatus vs. Attrition), and boxplots (Gender vs. Monthly Income).

  - Created a correlation heat map to identify key relationships.

- **Step 5**: Feature Engineering & Encoding
  - Applied label encoding and one-hot encoding on categorical variables such as BusinessTravel, Department, EducationField, Gender, JobRole, and MaritalStatus.
  - Split the dataset into independent variables (X) and the dependent variable (Attrition, y).
  - Performed Min-Max scaling for feature normalization.

- **Step 6**: Model Development & Evaluation
  - Prajwal split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Built and tested three models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost classifier.
  - Evaluated models using confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy scores‚Äîachieving approximately 90% accuracy with logistic regression.

- **Step 7**: Model Deployment Prep
  - Saved the best performing model as a pickle file to facilitate integration into HR tools.

##### Key Insights
- Employees who stayed tend to be older, live closer to work, have higher job and environment satisfaction, and possess larger stock option levels.
- Insights from the model enable HR to identify high-risk employees and develop personalized retention plans.
